## Process

The Project kicked off with a meeting to run through the purpose of the project and discuss potential solutions and ideas. The meeting was also carried out to ensure the team's focus and understanding of the requirements and needed deliverables.

Moving on, tasks were divided in two main areas, server side and client side. Tasks were allocated to each member of the team based on individual strengths and weaknesses. We had used GitHubs Kanban board to keep track of assigned tasks.

Throughout the development stages of the project several meetings took place over Slack to ensure everyone was meeting the targets and assistance was provided in any areas each member was unsure about. This approach proved to be of great benefit for performance and efficiency as we were able to stay on track and implement alot of the requirements on time. Additionaly, it helped keeping the team stay focused and motivated.

## Future Work

- Account creation, allowing users to create an account to keep track of their posts.
- Implementing more CRUD functionality such as allowing users to edit and delete their posts.
